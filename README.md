# 🩺 Breast Cancer Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Data Science Capstone Project focused on predicting the survival status (Living or Deceased) of breast cancer patients using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and tuning, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Project Objective
To build a predictive model that determines whether a breast cancer patient is likely to survive, based on clinical and genetic information.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following:
- Patient demographics
- Tumor characteristics
- Treatment types
- Genetic markers
- Survival status (Target variable: `0` = Deceased, `1` = Living)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling and evaluation
- **SVM**, **GridSearchCV** – Model training and tuning
